# EXCEL-CUSTOMER-SUCCESS-DASHBOARD
# OVERVIEW

STEP 1- SOURCE DATA

I Generated a dataset about an online store's customer success, measuring everything along the delivery, customer feedback and sales turnup and put it in a simple table

STEP 2- PIVOT TABLES AND CHARTS

Now that the data was prepared, i created and prepared the pivot table and chart and for this dashboad, i created five charts using:

• Smooth line Chart

• Doughnut Chart

• Waterfall Chart

• Horizontal Bar Chart


The waterfall chat required i copy the pivot table data outside and then insert a regular chat that refrences the copy data, futhermore i removed the uneccessary chart element.

STEP 3- DASHBOARD DESIGN

For this Dashboard, i used a dark background with a brighter, semi transparent gradient-style design. 

STEP 4- INSERT AND REDESIGN PIVOT CHARTS

The redesign process was to adjust the size and proportions and adjust the colouring 

STEP 5- INSERT SLICER

To top the overall design i created a custom slice design as the default slicer design
